# `src/data/` — persistence layer

The only place the Prisma client (`@/generated/prisma`, or the `@prisma/client`
re-export) may be imported. Every read and write of every entity goes through a
named function exported from here — `getPublicTournaments`, `saveMatchResult`, and
so on. There is one owner and one writer per entity.

**May import:** the Prisma client and generated schema types. `client.ts` constructs
the single shared `PrismaClient` instance (`@prisma/adapter-pg` over the pooled
`DATABASE_URL`) and exports it as `db`; `src/auth` imports `db` from here for Better
Auth's adapter and never imports the Prisma client directly.

**Must not import:** `src/actions`, `src/auth`, `src/app`, `src/components`, `next`,
`react`.

**Open item — `src/domain`:** `getStandings()` is specified (`epics.md` Story 3.2) to
compute the table from `Match` + `SetScore` via `src/domain`. AD-3 as written forbids
`data → domain`; this tension is unresolved (see `src/README.md`). The lint does not
block it; use it for pure read-time computation only.

Rules that live here:

- Public-read queries always filter `state != DRAFT`. Queries that include drafts
  are separate functions, called only from under `requireAdmin()`.
- The group standings table and final placements are **not** stored — computed on
  read from `Match` + `SetScore`. No cache, no materialized rows.
- Callers get named functions, never a raw `PrismaClient`.

Enforced by `eslint.config.mjs`: the Prisma-client ban everywhere outside this
directory, and a block keeping this directory from importing higher layers or the
framework.
